# Basic-Portfolio.io

This project is my first attempt at a portfolio. This project is a way to practice my new skills. This represents the starting point on my journey to learning code. I intend to inprove on my skills and create much more content.
My Basic-Portfolio is exactly what it says in the name. It has an about me, contact page, and an incomplete portfolio page.
